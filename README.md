# Set-PowerCfg
This simple script can be used to easily set or check the current power scheme being 
applied, these are the same settings found in Control Panel > Power Options.

This is particularly useful on laptops where CPU throttling may be an issue and there 
is a need to easily switch between power profiles, for example - plugged in vs running on 
battery.

The script is menu driven, just run it and select a menu option.

Usage:
./Set-PowerCfg.ps1
