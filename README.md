# Set-PowerCfg
Set-PowerCfg is a simple script that can be used to easily set or check the current power scheme being applied on a Windows host, these are the same settings found in Control Panel > Power Options.

This is particularly useful on laptops where CPU throttling may be an issue and you need to easily switch between power profiles, ie plugged in vs running on battery.

The script is menu driven, just run it and select a menu option.

Usage:
./Set-PowerCfg.ps1
